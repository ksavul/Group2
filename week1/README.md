# Group2: HelloWorld Solidity Interaction

Welcome to Group2's interactive Solidity project! This project allows you to interact with the `HelloWorld.sol` contract to change message strings and owners.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to clone this repository and have access to a local or remote Ethereum node.

## Usage

Follow the steps outlined below to interact with the `HelloWorld.sol` contract:

1. Visit the starting page, as shown in the snapshot below:

2. You can change the text variable by following the snapshot below:

3. If you try changing the text variable with a new owner and the transaction is reverted, it might look similar to the following snapshot:

4. If you change the text variable with a new owner and the transaction is accepted, it might look similar to the following snapshot:

## Reporting 

After interacting with the contract, you should write a report with each function execution. Include the transaction hash if the operation was successful, or the revert reason if it failed. 

You can find the transaction hash in the transaction receipt that is given after a successful transaction execution. If a transaction fails, the revert reason should be provided in the error message.

Please remember that interacting with blockchain contracts costs Ether (ETH), so make sure to have some in your account before starting.
